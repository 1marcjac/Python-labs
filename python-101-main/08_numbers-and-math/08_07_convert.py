# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
print(4*0.5)
# 2) Convert a float to an int
print(0.5+0.5)
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
print(10/0.5)
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
a = 3
b = 5
print(a*b)
# What information is lost during which conversions?
